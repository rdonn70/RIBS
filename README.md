# **RIBS** - Ryan's Insane Baseball Simulator (WIP)

## About
Ryan's Insane Baseball Simulator (RIBS for short) started as a weekend project in an attempt to create an accurate simulation of the sport of Baseball. Work on this project was started in the Summer of 2021, with a build that resulted in numerous issues such as high scoring (a typical game would result in a score of about 17-12). The old code is still available to download and run on Windows computers, see Download/Installation.
The current version of RIBS is still being worked on, and is not currently finished. This version overhauls the hitting kinematics calculations, the entire fielding system, and some minor modifications to character, league, and team generation.

## Features
Ryan's Insane Baseball Simulator (RIBS) currently only has one "game mode" which is called "Scrimmage" Mode. This program generates and simulates a complete Baseball game with fictional leagues, teams and players.
### Scrimage Mode
Scrimmage Mode generates two random teams and simulates a single game between the two teams. The user will be notified of the names of the two teams competing, and can observe the game through a primative ASCII representation of a field, complete with a scoreboard to represent the current score, count, and position of players on bases.
### Season Mode
Season Mode is currently not being developed. It is a planned feature, yet is available on the home menu as a placeholder. This mode will allow for the simulation of many games, each having an impact on the other and the overall ranking of the team in their respective league. This mode has a bundle of planned features including player trades, contract lengths and player skills being age-dependent.

## Download/Installation
Currently, this program can only be ran on Windows machines, it utilizes command line clear functionality as well as winsound. This may change in the future once there is a fully-working program. The stable version available to download is RIBS v0.0.0 available on this GitHub page and is simply an executable. Feel free to run the init file in command line to get the most up-to-date unstable version of the program.
