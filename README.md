# __**RIBS** - Ryan's Insane Baseball Simulator (WIP)__

## __About__
Ryan's Insane Baseball Simulator (RIBS for short) started as a weekend project attempting to create an accurate simulation of the sport of Baseball in Python. Work on this project started in Summer 2021, with a build that resulted in numerous issues such as unrealistic plays and scoring. The old code is still available to download and run on Windows computers (see Download/Installation).
The current version of RIBS is still being worked on, and is not currently finished. This version overhauls the hitting kinematics calculations, the entire fielding system, and some minor modifications to character, league and team generation.

## __Features__
Ryan's Insane Baseball Simulator (RIBS) currently only has one "game mode" which is called "Scrimmage" Mode. This program generates and simulates a complete Baseball game with fictional leagues, teams and players.
### __Scrimage Mode__
Scrimmage Mode generates two random teams and simulates a single game between the two teams. The user will be notified of the names of the two teams competing, and can observe the game through an ASCII representation of the field, complete with a scoreboard to represent the current score, count, and positions of players on bases.
### __Season Mode__
Season Mode is currently not being developed. It is currently only available on the home menu as a placeholder. This mode will allow for the simulation of a full Baseball season, with each game having an impact on others and the overall ranking of teams in their respective league. This mode has a bundle of planned features including player trades, contract lengths and player skills being age-dependent.

## __Download/Installation__
Currently, this program is only intended to be run on Windows machines, it utilizes command line clears that may not work correctly on other operating systems. The stable version available to download is RIBS v0.0.0 available on this GitHub page and is an executable. If you want to run the most up-to-date W.I.P. version, download all files (except the "merged" folder) and launch the "init" file from command line.
